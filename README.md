## Inspiration
We are exhasuted of wasting time scouring the internet looking for the best price for a product. There's no way to quickly compare prices across various websites without clicking through dozens of links so we decided to build one.

## What it does

Price Score lets you search through dozens of websites with just one click to help you make the most informed choice of where to buy your product from. 

It includes a shopping cart that is saved via cloud that you can access through signing in to your google account 

## How we built it

For the frontend we used React and Vite. Then we used Gumloop and Gemini in order to scrape the web for all the different prices. We also used Auth0 in order to ensure that only humans can access the website and also to allow users to save their shopping carts to their google account so that they can access them at any time. 

## Challenges we ran into

Two things we struggeled with a lot were reducing the amount of time that it takes to display results and scraping the web effectively to get as much info as possible. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Keeping our app secure from bots by using Auth0 and creating something that is useful for everyday purposes

## What we learned

How to keep our clients secure using Auth0 and how to complete a functional project in such a small time

## What's next for Price Scourer

Adding additonal features such as a price alert option that will send you email whenever your chosen product falls under a set price
